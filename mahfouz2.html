<p>My Hobbies:Hobbies can be pursued as a leisure activity. I like playing alot of sports. Also I like painting as it suits me mind and keeps me relaxed. I love dancing and singing as well beacause it keeps me active and healthy. It relaxes my minds and prepares me for another day of hard work. Since I am a CSE student, I code a lot to build websites, and create small games for friends. I like involving myself in chess matches too because chess players must constantly be thinking. While you may have a strategy in mind, your opponentâ€™s moves force you to almost constantly adapt it. Strategics like that can dramatically improve your intelligence and problem solving. These are some of the hobbies that I like engaging myself in. </p>
